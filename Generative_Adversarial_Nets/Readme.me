# Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)

This repository contains implementations and experiments for **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** as part of the Deep-Learning series. GANs are powerful generative models that learn to produce realistic synthetic data by training two neural networks in opposition: a **generator** and a **discriminator**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This project serves as both a learning resource and a foundation for advanced generative deep learning research and applications.

## About

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of generative models introduced in 2014 that have transformed areas such as image synthesis, data augmentation, and unsupervised representation learning. They consist of two models trained adversarially:

- **Generator**: learns to produce synthetic samples resembling real data  
- **Discriminator**: learns to distinguish real samples from synthetic ones

Through this adversarial training process, the generator progressively improves its outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This repository focuses on key GAN implementations, training pipelines, and evaluation.

## Key Features
