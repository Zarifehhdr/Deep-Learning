## overview

this repository contains multiple deep learning projects covering key areas in artificial intelligence:

- efficientnet architectures for scalable image classification
- generative adversarial networks (gans) for synthetic image generation
- image segmentation models for pixel-level understanding
- large language model (llama) based workflows
- lstm models for sequence modeling
- multimodal embedding experiments
- natural language processing (nlp) pipelines
- retrieval augmented generation (rag) systems
- translator models for language conversion
- variational autoencoders (vae) for unsupervised learning
- multi-label text classification notebook :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

each project is organized in its own folder with jupyter notebooks and supporting files to enable both learning and practical experimentation.

## why this matters

deep learning is one of the fastest-growing fields in ai and machine learning, powering breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, generative ai, and beyond. contributing or understanding these implementations indicates familiarity with real-world ai problems and solutions — a key asset when applying for roles in ai engineering, data science, and research. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
